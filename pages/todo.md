# {fas}`list` TODO
* Generate gemini site with [gemgen](https://sr.ht/~kota/gemgen)
* Some more theme customization
* Basic page tags; maybe make a custom sphinx directive if one doesn't already exist
* Some small articles about tech topics, nature, maybe photography
  * Less blog-like, more like... wiki pages or [evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org)?
