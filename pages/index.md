Hi there! My name is Jordan, and this is where I plan to write about some of my projects and things I'm learning about. My purposes for this site are to:
* Practice writing as a tool for organizing my thoughts
* Share info about some things I'm passionate about
* Participate in the indie web as a more pleasant alternative to social media
* Just build a website for the fun of it!

I don't have any articles up yet, but on the pages below I've summarized a few of my main hobbies
and favorite things:
