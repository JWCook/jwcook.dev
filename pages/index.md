Hi there! My name is Jordan, and this my personal site on the [tilde network](https://tildeverse.org).
I plan to write about some of my projects and serial obsessions here. My main purpose is organizing
my thoughts on things I'm learning about, and sharing info about some fun niches I'm into. I'm also
interested in exploring the indie web as a more fun alternative to social media.

I don't have any articles up yet, but on the pages below I've summarized a few of my main hobbies
and favorite things:
