Hi there! My name is Jordan, and this is where I plan to write about some of my projects and serial obsessions.
My main purpose is organizing my thoughts on things I'm learning about, and sharing info about some
fun niches I'm into.
I'm also interested in exploring the indie web as a more fun alternative to social media.

I don't have any articles up yet, but on the pages below I've summarized a few of my main hobbies
and favorite things:

* {ref}`asdf <admonition-name>`
* {ref}`ℹ️ <admonition-name>`
* {fas}`circle-info`
* {any}`AnyXRefRole <admonition-name>`
* {fa-ref}`asff <admonition-name>`
* [{fas}`circle-info`](#admonition-name)
