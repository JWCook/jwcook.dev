# {fab}`python` Open Source Projects
{bdg-secondary}`In Progress`

I develop and maintain a few open source projects, mainly python libraries. Here are a few of the
most interesting ones:

## requests-cache

My largest project is currently **requests-cache**, which is an HTTP caching library for python.

## pyinaturalist

I also work on a number of projects related to biodiversity data, mainly related to [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/). The most mature of these is **pyinaturalist**, which is a python library for interacting with the iNaturalist API.

## Naturtag

A related but less mature project I'm currently developing is **Naturtag**, which is a desktop
application and CLI tool for nature photographers. Its goal is to simplify photography workflow and
organization by embedding useful biodiversity metadata into image files using
[XMP](https://exiftool.org/TagNames/XMP.html) and [Darwin Core](https://www.tdwg.org/standards/dwc).

Yeah, that's kind of a mouthful... I need to work on my elevator pitch. It's a really fun project to
work on, though, because I'm primarily making it for myself, and it's in a relatively small niche
that no other tools (that I know of) currently fill.

## Other
* A number of other small projects can be found [on my GitHub profile](https://github.com/jwcook)
* This site and any other tilde-specific repos will be on [tildegit](https://tildegit.org/jwcook)

## Getting involved
If you are a python developer looking for ways to get involved in open source, I am willing to
mentor new contributors on any of these projects. Feel free to reach out either here or on GitHub.
