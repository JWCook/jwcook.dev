# {fas}`code` About this site
```{tags} status:draft, docs
```

This is a markdown-based static site generated with [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org) and
[MyST](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io). The theme is modified from
[Furo](https://pradyunsg.me/furo) with a palette based on [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox).

Source code can be found here: https://tildegit.org/jwcook/jwcook.tilde.team

If you have any questions about how this site is built, or are interested in using Sphinx and/or
MyST to set up your own site in the tildeverse, you are welcome to
[drop me a line](mailto:jwcook@tilde.team).
